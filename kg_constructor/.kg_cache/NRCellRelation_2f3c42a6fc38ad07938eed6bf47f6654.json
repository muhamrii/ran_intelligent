{"schema_fp": "2f3c42a6fc38ad07938eed6bf47f6654", "description": "This table `NRCellRelation` stores information about relationships between 5G NR cells, including cell IDs, location, allowed handover and removal actions, frequency relations, and coverage.\n\n- `dateTime`: Timestamp indicating when the relationship data was recorded.\n- `Area_Name`: Name of the geographical area where the cells are located (e.g., 'NR_Balikpapan').\n- `CellId`: Unique identifier for a 5G NR cell.\n- `Id2`:  Redundant/duplicate identifier for a 5G NR cell (likely a backup or alternative ID).\n- `Id3`: Another  identifier for a related 5G NR cell.\n- `Id4`: Yet another identifier for a related 5G NR cell.\n- `vsDataType`: Data type identifier indicating this entry represents NR cell relations.\n- `vsDataFormatVersion`: Specifies the version of the Ericsson-specific data format.\n- `NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo`:  (Likely empty, needs further context to define).\n- `NRCellRelation.coordinationType`: (Likely empty, needs further context to define).\n- `NRCellRelation.nRCellRelationId`: Unique identifier for this specific cell relationship.\n- `NRCellRelation.caStatusActive`: (Likely empty, needs further context to define).\n- `NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate`: Status of whether a cell is a candidate for handover ('NOT_ALLOWED' example given).\n- `NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed`: Boolean indicating whether handover is allowed between the cells in this relation ('true' or 'false').\n- `NRCellRelation.nRFreqRelationRef`: Reference to the frequency relation between the cells involved.\n- `NRCellRelation.isRemoveAllowed`: Boolean indicating whether removing this cell relation is allowed ('true' or 'false').\n- `NRCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetNR`:  Individual cell offset value (in NR).\n- `NRCellRelation.nRCellRef`: Reference to the 5G NR cell involved in this relationship.\n- `NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator`: Indicates the coverage type associated with the cell relationship.\n- `NRCellRelation.includeInSIB`:  (Likely empty, needs further context to define, possibly related to System Information Block inclusion)."}
