Columns describe parameters like timestamp (`dateTime`), geographical area (`Area_Name`), cell identifiers (`CellId`, `Id2`, `Id3`), frequency identifiers (`Id4`, `EUtranFreqRelation.eUtranFreqRelationId`, `EUtranFreqRelation.eutranFrequencyRef`), data type/version (`vsDataType`, `vsDataFormatVersion`), and various thresholds, priorities, and offsets related to handover, cell selection, and quality measurements (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ, Qoffset) for both connected and idle modes, including parameters for Carrier Aggregation (CA),  End-to-End (E2E) handover, and Cell-Specific Group (CSG).  It also includes metadata such as creation and modification timestamps and user information."}
