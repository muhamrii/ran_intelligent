Likely a data redundancy.\n- `Id3`:  Unknown identifier; requires further investigation.\n- `Id4`:  Concatenated string representing both local and remote endpoints, potentially redundant.\n- `vsDataType`:  Indicates the type of data; in this case, it's specific to User Plane links.\n- `vsDataFormatVersion`: Version of the data format used (Ericsson Specific Attributes).\n- `RpUserPlaneLink.rpUserPlaneLinkId`: Unique identifier for the User Plane link (concatenation of local and remote endpoints).\n- `RpUserPlaneLink.remoteEndPoint`: IP address of the remote endpoint of the User Plane link.\n- `RpUserPlaneLink.localEndPoint`: IP address of the local endpoint of the User Plane link."}
